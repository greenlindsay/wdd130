                    Welcome to my site! I'm so excited to meet you all. My 
                    name is Lindsay Green and I am 22 years old. I was 
                    born and raised in Orem, Utah and lived there 
                    all of my life until I 
                    moved away to go to college at Brigham Young University-Idaho 
                    in Rexburg, Idaho the September after graduating high school in 
                    2019. <br> <br>
                    I began my photography journey around the age of 
                    15 when I was in junior high because my older brother
                    had taken an interest in it and I wanted to be just like
                    him. After that point, I took a few photography classes and
                    developed my own photography style and began taking photographs
                    for family and friends. 
                    <br> <br>People seemed to like my work, so 
                    I decided to make something that had been my side hobby 
                    into something I could pursue as a career and I think it
                    has worked out pretty well so far! Other than photography,
                    I enjoy drawing, painting, knitting and crocheting, reading,
                    and going on hikes. If there's anything else you would like
                    to know about me, feel free to contact me! :)
