        Intro
        </p>
        <p>
        The personal website that I have chosen to create is 
        a photography website. I have always been interested 
        in photography and would love to see how my photographs 
        would look on a professional website, laid out in an 
        attractive way for users to look at and consider having 
        their pictures taken by me. I have always liked dark 
        colored site themes and therefore want my website to 
        utilize darkly colored background colors with 
        photographs that appeal to my aesthetic while still 
        appealing to the type of clients I want to obtain’s 
        aesthetics as well so that I can work alongside clients 
        who I can work well with and who have a similar vision to 
        mine as to how they want their images to turn out. 
      </p>
        <p>
        Audience
        </p>
        <p>
	      My projected audience is family, friends, or any other 
        person who needs photos taken for any reason—work and 
        portfolios, family photos for wall décor, newborn or 
        maternity photos, etc. I plan to focus mostly on 
        portrait photography because portrait photography is 
        my favorite type of photography to create and edit, 
        although I do love the other types as well. I love to 
        make people feel beautiful and incorporate them into 
        my art in ways that other photographers may not be 
        able to, and I hope to make that known to my potential 
        clients through the work that is displayed on my site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Purpose
        </p>
        <p>
        People will come to my site hoping to find content 
        that will pertain to how they want to be captured in 
        photos based on the images that I post on my site, 
        and then hopefully contact me with inquiries using my 
        provided contact info. My website will answer 
        questions about pricing, locations/how far I’m 
        willing to travel, contact information, FAQs, and 
        some “about me” info. 
        </p>
        <p>
        As I stated in the first paragraph, I am planning to 
        have a mainly dark-colored background with lightly 
        colored decorative fonts with lots of photographs 
        that I have taken being featured over a large portion 
        of my home page’s layout, of course (since it is a 
        photography website). I plan to feature a variety of 
        different types of photographs that I could take for 
        clients, including, but not limited to,  portraits, 
        family photos, landscape photography, pet photos, 
        professional headshots for resumes and other 
        job-related needs, and any other type of photos they 
        need taken and that they trust me to create for them.

        <img src="images/hannah.jpg" alt="Hannah">

      </ul>
      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <p>
        I expect to have my contact information in the footer 
        of the page as well as links to my social media and my 
        FAQ page (which will be featured on a secondary page), 
        which will include questions that I have either been 
        asked in the past about my photography or questions that
        I expect to be asked as a photographer pertaining to my
        experience and preferences as well as basic info such as
        how I expect to be paid and my terms and things like that. 
        At the top of the FAQ page I will include a section 
        regarding pricing depending on the type of photographs 
        needed which may answer some other questions potential 
        clients may have.

      </ul>
      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        The third page I expect to include (not necessarily 
        in that order) will be my “about me” page which will 
        tell about my past—where I am from, my family, my 
        interests and hobbies, how I came to get into 
        photography, where and what I am studying, my 
        photography goals, etc. so that my clients can 
        know where I came from, get to know me better 
        since they will be working very closely alongside me, 
        and know where I plan to take my business in the future.
