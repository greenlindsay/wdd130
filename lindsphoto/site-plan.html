      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to my site! I'm so excited to meet you all. My 
        name is Lindsay Green and I am 22 years old. I was 
        born and raised in Orem, Utah and lived there 
        all of my life until I 
        moved away to go to college at Brigham Young University-Idaho 
        in Rexburg, Idaho the September after graduating high school in 
        2019. I began my photography journey around the age of 
        15 when I was in junior high because my older brother
        had taken an interest in it and I wanted to be just like
        him. After that point, I took a few photography classes and
        developed my own photography style and began taking photographs
        for family and friends. People seemed to like my work, so 
        I decided to make something that had been my side hobby 
        into something I could pursue as a career and I think it
        has worked out pretty well so far! Other than photography,
        I enjoy drawing, painting, knitting and crocheting, reading,
        and going on hikes. If there's anything else you would like
        to know about me, feel free to contact me! :)
