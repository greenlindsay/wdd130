    <h2>Lindsay Green</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Lindsay Green. I am an accounting major and am doing a cluster in programming.
        I really love to play violin and do arts and crafts-type things like knitting and crocheting, painting, etc.
        I also love photography, working out, and hanging out with friends. <br>
        <br>
        I'm not married nor do I have any children! I'm actually looking for a job now so if you know of one let me know lol.
        I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree in accounting and I love the people here at BYU-I because everyone is so nice and friendly.
        I'm taking this course because I need it for my accounting cluster and I had gained an interest in programming classes
        after I took my Excel VBA class, so I'm excited to learn more programming languages and get more acquainted.
        The programming world is getting larger every day and there's a huge industry in it so I am interested in the possible
        opportunities that learning more about programming may grant me.<br>
        <br>
        I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints my whole life. 
        I have a couple favorite quotes from leaders of the Church but somehow can't think of any at the moment!
        There was a quote from Elder Bednar (I think?) that said something like, "Just do the best you can, in the best way you know how, and He will fill in the rest." <br>
        <br>
        I'm excited for this semester!
    </p>
